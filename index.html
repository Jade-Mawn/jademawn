                My name is Jade Mawn. I am a junior at the University of Richmond studying Mathematics 
                and Computer Science. I'm a French Minor and recently began learning Spanish.
                Beyond classes, I have been a barista for several years and currently work in the University of Richmond's 
                dining services. I'm also very passionate about baking, having made hundreds of loaves of 
                bread and written a collection of original recipes which I am in the process of publishing. 
                In my spare time I enjoy making art of many different mediums. I have taken classes in printmaking, 
                ceramics, photography, and music. I have begun involving this artistic interest with my studies 
                by using art as a medium to share the work of a research team I am a part of. I recently presented 
                a piece of this work at the Bridges conference. I am an avid traveler and learner, I am always looking
                for opportunities to learn something new, see a new place or experience new a culture. This website serves 
                as a general blog of my interests and projects.

                            I've recently begun working on the development of a news website the Chesapeake Times. I built and 
                            launched a website using Next.js for student writers to share news articles. I used Sanity.io for 
                            easy publishing, and designed the site with Tailwind CSS and Schadcn for a smooth, responsive experience. 
                            The site is currently live at chesapeaketimes.netlify.app, and I’m working on moving it to 
                            chesapeake-times.com for the official launch by the end of February.

                        <p>I recently began two new roles in the Computer Science Department 
                            at the University of Richmond. This fall, I will be assisting with 
                            two of my favorite courses: Data Structures and Software Systems. 
                            For Data Structures, I will be working as a drop-in tutor, available on a 
                            weekly basis to all students in the course. For Software Systems, I attend 
                            lab sessions and help students with questions about the material and troubleshooting 
                            code. Both of these roles are enjoyable ways to stay engaged with previous material
                             and get to know more students within the major.

                            Over the past year, I have been working alongside a team led by one of my professors, researching webs.
                             Webs are diagrammatic representations used in the study of quantum groups to encode vectors in specific 
                             vector spaces. As a visual representation of mathematical concepts, I found that the webs we studied lend 
                             themselves to being aesthetically appealing. Inspired by this, I created a piece of art using ink to represent 
                             an sl4 web. This artwork was accepted into the Bridges Conference and was displayed to a sizable audience. 
                             At the conference, I also had the opportunity to attend many intriguing lectures on a wide range of mathematical topics.

                        <p>Over the summer I spent eight weeks on conducting research at the University of Richmond with a team of other students 
                            under the guidance of Dr. Heather Russell. This research was on Webs, specifically sl3 webs, which are diagrammatic representations used to encode vectors in specific 
                            vector spaces. Over the summer we were successful in proving three new theorems on these webs as well as refuting some existing 
                            conjectures. Personally I was very involved in writing programs to help generate new information and visualization of these webs.

                            I started this website as a personal project to learn basic web development skips and to

                            web development so everything I self-taught.
