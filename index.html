                My name is Jade Mawn. I am a junior at the University of Richmond studying Mathematics 
                and Computer Science. I'm a French Minor and recently began learning Spanish.
                Beyond classes, I have been a barista for several years and currently work in the University of Richmond's 
                dining services. I'm also very passionate about baking, having made hundreds of loaves of 
                bread and written a collection of original recipes which I am in the process of publishing. 
                In my spare time I enjoy making art of many different mediums. I have taken classes in printmaking, 
                ceramics, photography, and music. I have begun involving this artistic interest with my studies 
                by using art as a medium to share the work of a research team I am a part of. I recently presented 
                a piece of this work at the Bridges conference. I am an avid traveler and learner, I am always looking
                for opportunities to learn something new, see a new place or experience new a culture. This website serves 
                as the.

                            Over the past year, I have been working alongside a team led by one of my professors, researching webs.
                             Webs are diagrammatic representations used in the study of quantum groups to encode vectors in specific 
                             vector spaces. As a visual representation of mathematical concepts, I found that the webs we studied lend 
                             themselves to being aesthetically appealing. Inspired by this, I created a piece of art using ink to represent 
                             an sl4 web. This artwork was accepted into the Bridges Conference and was displayed to a sizable audience. 
                             At the conference, I also had the opportunity to attend many intriguing lectures on a wide range of mathematical topics.
